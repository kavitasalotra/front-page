#### Things People Get Wrong About Gatsby

“Gatsby doesn’t do dynamic.” We shipped server-side rendering (SSR) and deferred static generation (DSG) in Gatsby v4 last fall. With server-side rendering – or even without SSR – you can use Gatsby for A/B testing and personalization. Need to call third-party services live? Just wrap your call in a Gatsby Function so you can call the service without exposing API keys.

- Gatsby doesn’t do dynamic
- Gatsby is for small sites
- Gatsby doesn’t do live data.

**_Gatsby is for small sites_**

> Today, sites like Rich Brilliant Willing, Penn State News, and FestivalPass have 100k+ pages on Gatsby Cloud with build times in minutes. Just make sure you use Gatsby v4+ and Gatsby Cloud to take full advantage of our build speeds.

**_Gatsby doesn’t do live data_**

> If your data is coming from a CMS like Contentful, Gatsby Cloud will pull, build, and deploy your update in under 5 seconds. If you’re talking weather or sports scores, you can make a live query to an external service from a React component every 5 or 15 seconds. And if your service is auth-gated, just use Gatsby Functions.
